# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects clone

The 5 projects in this repo are part of the [freeCodeCamp Front End Development](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#front-end-libraries-projects) curriculum. Every project passed all the tests from freeCodeCamp. 

My primary goal is to pass all the tests from freeCodeCamp. But at the same time I try to style the apps to look as close to the original design as possible. As I am not experience in UI design I reckon it's better to clone an existing one instead of designing something that doesn't look good.
